# Day 4
- Advanced CSS!
- @media screen and <conditions>
- Need to get a better sense of when to use min- and max-width for @media.
- @media is a media selector (verify).
- display flex is new. Includes grow, shrink, and basis.
- There’s also flex-wrap.
- display: flex and flex-wrap: wrap must be applied to parent element not the element itself.
- flex-direction is another property. There’s row and column. It determines the access of its children.
- Order is another property we can use to reorder how the browser displays elements.
- What is <aside>? For sidemenus and things like that? Should research.

- justify-content is another propery.
- align-items does the same for the opposite axis (relative to flex-direction).
- vh and vw = view height and view width (percentage of the viewport, e.g. 100vh or 50vw).
- These things should be applied to the actual items in the flex box container.
- These tools are great for centering items along either axis!

- tranform is another propery. There’s rotate, scale, and skew.
- rotate(60deg)
- scale(x, y)
- skew(15deg)
- You can use deg and rad (radians)
