Day 14: 
- Bootstrap!
- There’s a version 5 I should check out.
- It’s a way to use CSS without using as much JS.
- With Bootstrap, you don’t write CSS, you just add classes.
- Wait, does Bootstrap override with `!important`?
- It’s important to remember it’s a third-party API you import.
- Does Bootstrap provide flexbox support?
- Can you use your JavaScript to add Bootstrap classes? Is that recommended for JS developers?
- Does Bootstrap come with a reset.css stylesheet?
- Competitors could be Tailwind. Also Material UI.
- Would be good to look through their docs (and focus on 5).
- Bootstrap divides thing into 12 columns. If you say 12, it’s 100%. It kind of works like flex (but they came before, and so maybe it’s less necessary?).
- Bootstrap uses media queries.
- The changes for screen size are powered by “breakpoints”.
- You can use your own CSS in your own file to add your own flavor.
- Remember that Bootstrap take priority (because of `!important`).
- Reminder: `:root` is how you create variables in CSS.

- Google Fonts!
- `<link>` may be better, but `@import`? Looks like `<link>` is better supported.
- You can use for your site, but also download and install. I wonder if they’re available through brew?
- Looks like you could also download and include them with your app.
	- You can also use `@font-face` with `font-family` and `src` attributes. This is maybe better from a security point of view (so Google isn’t listening).
