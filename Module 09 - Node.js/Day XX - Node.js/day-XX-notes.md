- Arrow functions are important.
- Context matters.
- this binds.
- If an arrow function doesn’t work, you can use an anonymous function.
- Instead of var, we should use let an const. const is a variable that never changes (and it can’t, you’ll get an error).
- Make sure to learn forEach, filter, and map.
