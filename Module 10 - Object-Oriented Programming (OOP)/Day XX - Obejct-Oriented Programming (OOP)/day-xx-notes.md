Day XX - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Object constructors.
- Prototypes. You can extend an object with prototypes.
- A constructor function is use to create new objects.
- A constructor function is not concerned with the specifics.
- All object have a prototype.
- Prototypes extend object constructor functions.
- A method is an unnamed function.
- Method is a function owned by an object!
---
- Promises.
- const willGetSwitch = new Promise ( (resolve, reject) ) => {...}.
- Should also look at async functions with try. Better way to do promises.
---
- Promise.all lets you wait for multiple promises to be done.
- Promise.all([firstPromise, secondPromise])
- .then( (values) => {} )
- You put in an array of promises, it waits for them to be fulfilled, and something-something.
