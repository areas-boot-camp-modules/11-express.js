# Day 3
- Paragraph elements are block elements by default.
- Div is a block element.
- Something like an image or link is inline by default.
- This relates to display: block and display: inline.

- text-align applies to everything, not just text.
- css-grid is great for building grids.
- Should study the box model more througouhly.

- Positioning: static, relative (to its parent), absolute, and fixed.
- What’s the point of absolute?
- You can keep an element on the page with postion: fixed.
- You can’t add an offset to static.
- Something that’s positioned absolute is relative to the first parent that position relative?
- Should re-review this topic, too.
- Absolute and fixed not used that often.

- Semantic elements are clear. No divs or spans.
- “logical structure independent…” means that stuff for the header goes in the header section, and so on.
