# Day 6
- Last day of CSS.
- Figma is a popular tool for design, and it’s free.
- Should download it and add it to the script.
- Wireframes are not meant to be pixel-perfect.
- The mini-project is a 3-column layout (not a row flow).
- nth-cild is another pseudo element. You can pass even, odd, and probably a bunch of other values *(for example, you can add numbers, like 4 for the 4th element).
- The important thing to remember is :nth-child.
- + is sibling.
- > is children.
- Attribute selector.
- You can use something like a[href*=“contains-this”].
- *= means contain.
- $= means must end with.

- CSS variables.
- Variables are powerful, and useful for front-end devs.

- Project was hard.
- To get the glow, use transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out.
- Also, use box-shadow: ….
- white-space: pre-wrap is important.
- What is em and rem exactly? Need to review.
- Re-review the solution to understand how to build it.
