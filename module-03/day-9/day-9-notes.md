# Day 9
- Objects!
- Primitives are not objects, except in the case of strings!
- An array is an object.
- JavaScript didn’t used to have classes, which is why objects are so important.
- You cannot change the value of a `const`. Makes it safe to use without worrying about whether the value has changed.
---
- Objects can include arrays and functions.
---
- `this` refers to current object.
- `this` is used in a function that’s part of an object.
---
- Functions are also objects.
- What’s bind? Might be worth looking up.
