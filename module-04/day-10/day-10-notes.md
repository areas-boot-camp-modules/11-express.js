# Day 10
- DOM.
- this and window is the same (when you’re at the top level).
- You can use document.body to access HTML.
- When you log something like window.document, you don’t bring in all the children (but the browser shows them to you, for ease)
- All elements (such as document.body) have a children array.
---
- You can chain to access. For example, document.body.children[1].children[0].
- It’s better/easier to get something something by its id. For example, document.getElementById("<css-id>").
- That’s why it’s important that id are unique.
- You can then access and change the CSS.
---
- querySelectorAll finds the first element that matches.
- You can use .setAttribute to set an attribute, such as style or src.
- You can even add an attribute that doesn’t exist (for example, give an element a class).
---
- You can create a new element with createElement("p").
- You can also add content in element with textContent.
- And finally, there’s .appendChild("p").
---
- most time values are in miliseconds.
- We can use setInterval to wait.
- You have to clearInterval to stop.
- There’s something called setTimeout that’s similar.
