# Day 13: Third-Party APIs
- Third-party APIs!
- We’ve mostly been looking at browser APIs. Now we’ll look at third-party APIs (jQuery first).
- jQuery isn’t really used for new projects anymore, but it’s around.
- When you’re looking at a third-party API, look for good docs and a strong community.
- Google fonts is a nice thing to look at. Is it an API?
- Browsers processes JavaScript. As you pull in libraries, it can start to slow down the user’s browsers. That’s why libraries are minified.
- `$` in jQuery is the same as `document.querySelector` (for an ID). If you pass HTML, it’ll create HTML for you.
- There are a bunch of equivalents.
- Why use jQuery when you can use DOM elements? You probably shouldn’t for new projects (DOM is faster). But it’s useful to know.
