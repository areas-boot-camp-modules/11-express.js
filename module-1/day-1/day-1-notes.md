# Day 1
- Name: Christian
- From: Oakland, CA
- Reason for joining: Widen my skill set (I’m a Technical Writer)
- Interesting fact: I love running and mechanical keyboards. I also used to work for Apple, but am spending time traveling right now!

- The pace is fast!
- 20-30 hours per week.
- BootCampSpot is an extension of Canvas. It’s the central hub for the boot camp.
- Office hours are in the same zoom.
- Drop deadline is **Sept. 13 2022**.

- We will be building a landing page (module 1).

-  Debugging may not be covered in class, but it can be covered in office hours. Maybe it’s something I can bring up elsewhere, such as 1-1 sessions. Would be nice to learn!
