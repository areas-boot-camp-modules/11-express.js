# Day 2
- The class files are also in GitLab.
- I should use that to organize my files for class.
- Also, remember to retain “Unsolved” folders, and dupe it to a new “Solved” folder.
- rel=“stylesheet" tells the browser it’s a stylesheet. Not really other examples where you need to use this attribute.
- What is viewport? Makes it mobile friendly. Worth looking into it more?
- There’s a style block ({}) and it contains CSS rules (each line).
- Hex codes = rrggbb!
- ff is the highest range for a particular color.
- Rules defined first in a CSS file will override later rules (if you happened to have it twice).
- You should also add type="text/css" to the link element (for a link to a CSS file).
- Not really clear when you should and shouldn’t use div’s. Should potentially research.
- Hex codes are more specific than regular colors in CSS.
- With CSS, there are different selectors, such as element, class, or id.

- Moving forward, I should def. complete all in-class assignments before the class. That way, I can ask questions when I get to class!
