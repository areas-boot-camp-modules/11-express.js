# Day 8
- Arrays!
- You can store multiple values in an array, such `let students = ["Christian"]`.
- In Python, an array is called a list.
- Arrays are zero-indexed.
- You can replace a value in an array (`student[2] = "<new-name>";`).
- What is strict mode?
- An array is an object.
---
- For-loops!
- People usually use i, but you don't have to.
- Instead of a number for i, you can use an array’s length.
---
- Functions!
- You can use anonymous functions to control scope.
- There are function declarations and function expressions.
- You can use `return;` to escape a function early.
- What’s a funtion closure?
- Anonymous functions are considered "throw away" functions. We’ll learn more later!
---
- Scope!
- You can return something to make it available.
- You can also return a function that uses a variable and make that available outside.
- What’s shadowing?
- You can redefine something inside a function, and that will only change the value within the function. It will stay the same value outside.
- You call a function.
- You return something to make it available outide the function.
- Good practice to avoid shadows (can be confusing an cause problems).
- Parenthesis tell the browser that it’s a function.
---
- Methods!
- You can use `console.trace` to do a stack trace (to track something down).
- You can sort an array (.sort).
- You can add something new with .push("thing to add").
- You can slice with .slice(0,2). It creates a new array, starting with 0-index and ending with 2-index.
- There’s also .replace.
